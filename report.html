    <h1>Solving Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem<br>With Genetic Algorithm</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This work is about Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem as described <a href="http://dag.informatik.uni-kl.de/research/meb/">here</a>:</p>

    <p class="citation">The Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem (MEB) is an NP-hard optimization problem in Wireless Ad-hoc Networks. One node in this network needs to transmit a message to all other nodes. In the wireless setting, multiple nodes can be reached with a single transmission. Also, the message can be forwarded by nodes that have already received it. A solution for the MEB is a (directed) tree rooted at the source node that reaches all nodes of the network. The necessary overall transmission power is to be minimized, i. e. sum of the individual transmission costs.</p>

    <p>Goal of this work is to implement solution for MEB using standard genetic algorithm and compare it to other existing solutions.</p>

    <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>

    <p>There are many heuristic algorithms for the broadcast problem. One of them is Broadcast Incremental Power algorithm (BIP) [2] which is a heuristic algorithm that builds broadcast tree similarly to Prim’s algorithm for building Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). This algorithm does not necessarily find an optimal solution for MEB.</p>

    <p>Finding optimal solution can be done using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). This however requires extensive computational power.</p>

    <p>Very interesting solution is Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) presented in [1]. This algorithm is able to find optimal or near-optimal solutions and outperforms previous existing heuristics. It begins by constructing solution using BIP algorithm mentioned above. Then it generates population of improving solutions using mutation and local search. The best solution is chosen for next iteration. The mutation randomly increases range of some random nodes. During local search ranges are being decreased.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    <p>Algorithm is implemented in JavaScript and it only requires web browser for running without additional plugins. It includes visualization of the problem and solution. It is tested in Chrome 19, Firefox 11 and Opera 11.</p>

    Pseudo code of genetic algorithm:
    <pre>initialize population with random individuals
while termination condition is not met:
    copy the best individual to new population (elitism)
    while population size is not reached:
        select two parents (with tournament selection)
        create offspring individuals from parents (with 2-point crossover)
        apply mutation (decrease or increase range by random value)
        correct solutions to be feasible
        add to new population</pre>

    <h3>Representation</h3>

    <p>The genotype is an array of numbers. The length of the array is the number of nodes. Gene represents how far each node broadcasts. For example 0 means it does not broadcast, 1 means it broadcasts to the range of its closest neighbor node, 2 means range to the second closest node and so on.</p>

    <h3>Fitness function</h3>

    <p>Fitness function returns sum of power used by each node which we try to minimize. Power of the node is computed as a Euclidean distance of broadcasted range over parameter alpha. Value of alpha is usually 2, meaning that power required depends on the squared value of the distance.</p>

    <h3>Correction Algorithm</h3>

    <p>Crossover and mutation operations may produce infeasible individual where some nodes are not connected. A correction algorithm is used. Here is a pseudo code:</p>
    <pre>initialize closed list with source node
traverse tree with BFS (Breadth-first search) from source node
for each node ordered by distance from source node:
    if the node is not in closed:
        if probability:
            select best new parent from nodes in closed
        else:
            select random parent
        increase range of parent to include node
        do BFS from node</pre>

    <h2>Experiments</h2>

    <p>Same testing data sets were used as in [1]. They are available online <a href="http://dag.informatik.uni-kl.de/research/meb/">here</a>. Each set contains 30 instances for 20 and 50 nodes with random location. Parameter alpha is 2.</p>

    <p>Experiments were running on a Intel dual core CPU 1,6 GHz in Chrome browser (V8 JavaScript engine). Following parameters were used: population size = 100, tournament size = 3, probability crossover = 75%, probability mutation = 12%, probability of correction with random node = 20%. One individual computed using BIP heuristic was inserted in the initial population. Algorithm stopped when no improving solution was found after 2000 iterations.</p>
    
    <p>Each instance of the problem was executed 3 times and average value was taken. Key to the table: dataset instance, percentage excess over optimal solution, number of times optimal solution was found, time when the best solution was found, total running time, generation when the best solution was found, total number of generations</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Implementation gives very good results for instances with 20 nodes, finding optimal solutions most of the cases or the solutions are very close to optimal values. The quality of results is comparable to ELS. However, for instances with 50 nodes solution quality is quite poor, excessing optimal values by more than 10%. ELS is generally much faster and gives better results.</p>
